# ALGORITHM OF THE CODE

# 1. start programme
# 2. get input integer a (num 1)
# 3. get input integer b (num 2)
# 4. get input integer c (num 3)
# 5. if the condition (a>b) is true go to line 6 and 11
# 6. print a is the biggest number
# 7. else if condition (b>c) is ture go to line 8 and 11
# 8. print b is the biggest number
# 9. else the before both condition became false go to line 10 and 11
# 10. print c is biggest number
